# Cracking the Vault

## Points :250 <br />
## Description : <br />
> The vault is locked with a key, but we've managed to access a security computer. Unfortunately, the key is encrypted, and the owner forgot to remove the file that encrypts it. It appears to be some sort of homemade encryption, but donâ€™t worry this should be a piece of cake for you, right?

## File :	  <br />
> [VaultKey_encrypted.txt](VaultKey_encrypted.txt) <br />
[Encryption.py](Encryption.py)


## Solution : 	<br />
We were given a Python script to decrypt the encrypted key.
We should follows the reverse of the encryption steps:
1. Undo character shifts
2. Recover the original key sum
3. Undo XOR transformation
4. Remove padding

Here is my decryption [Script](decrypt.py)
