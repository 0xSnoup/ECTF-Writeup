To decode it, I separated characters at odd and even indices. The first part `ch1` collected every second character starting from index 1, while the second part `ch2` collected every second character from index 2. Finally, I reversed `ch2` and concatenated it with `ch1` to reconstruct the flag.

`Flag : ectf{y0U_5p1N_M3_R1GhT_R0unD_B4bY}`
